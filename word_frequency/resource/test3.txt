Exploratory method
Treat the program as a black box, ignoring its internal structure.
White box method
Explore the software while designing and executing tests
simultaneously.

SE-307 Software Testing Techniques
Purpose
Functional testing Verify the functionalities of the system against the
regression testing Verify that changes to the software do not break the
 functionalities of the previous version.
Load testing Verify the behavior of the system under both normal and
 anticipated peak load conditions.
Stress testing Verify the behavior of the system beyond its capacity.

Reliability testing Verify that the failure rate of the software is under an
acceptable level.
Usability testing Verify that the ease of using and learning the software. 
Validation testing Verify that the software delivers what the users expect
 (alpha testing and beta testing).
